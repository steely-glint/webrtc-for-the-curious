# What is Data 


## Functional Overview
Data channel can deliver any types of data. If you wish, you send send audio or video
data over the data channel too, but if you need to playback the media in real-time,
using media channels (See [Media Communication]({{< ref "05-media-communication.md" >}})) that uses RTP/RTCP protocols are the better options.

### What are the applications of data channel?
Applicability of the data channel is unlimited! The data channel solves packet loss,
congestion problems and many other stuff for you and provide you with very simple
API to deliver you your data to your peer in real-time. You just need to focus on what
your application wants to achieve, and be creative.

Here are some example applications using the data channel:
  - Real-time network games
  - Serverless home automation from remote
  - Text chat
  - Animation (series of still images)
  - P2P CDN (Content Delivery Network)
  - Monitoring data from IoT
  - Continuous ingestion of time-series data from sensor devices
  - Real-time image recognition with AI from cameras

### Protocol Stack Overview
The data channel is comprised of the following 3 layers:
* Data Channel Layer
* DCEP (Data channel Establishment Protocol) Layer
* SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) Layer

#### Data Channel Layer
This layer provides API.
The API largely mimics that of WebSockets, masking it relatively easy for web developers
to repurpose existing client-server websocket based code to work over the P2P datachannel.
A single peerconnection can have many datachannels to a peer saving you the bother
multiplexing and demultiplexing different data sources and sinks. Just create a datachannel per
class of data you need to exchange and the peerconnection does the rest.
Unlike websockets datachannels have lables which are assigned by the creator and can be used by
recipient to figure out which datachannel is which.


#### Data channel Establishment Protocol Layer
This layer is responsible for the data channel handshake with the peer. It uses a
SCTP stream as a control channel to negotiate capabilities such as ordered delivery,
maxRetransmits/maxPacketLifeTime (a.k.a. "Partial-reliability"), send the channel's lable etc.


#### SCTP Protocol Layer
This is the heart of the data channel. What it does includes:

* Channel multiplexing (In SCTP, channels are called "streams")
* Reliable delivery with TCP-like retransmission mechanism
* Partial-reliability options
* Congestion Avoidance
* Flow Control

## Data Channel API
### Connection / Teardown
### Data Channel Options
### Flow Control API

## Data Channel in Depth
### SCTP
#### Connection establishment flow
#### Connection teardown flow
#### Keep-alive mechanism
#### How does a user message get sent?
#### TSN and retransmission
#### Congestion avoidance
#### Selective ACK
#### Fast retransmission/recovery
#### Partial Reliability

### DCEP
DCEP is a simple 2 packet protocol which describes the behaviour of a given datachannel.
It does not require a network round trip, so subsequent data for the channel can be included in the same packet.
This makes establishing datachanels fast and cheap.

Here is a list of chanel types and the associated meaning of the reliability parameter
that will be applied when packets are lost or misordered.

Reliable is largely equivelent to TCP.

Reliable_Unordered requires a special mention. It means that when a packet is dropped by the network only the message that the packet is part of will be delayed until it is resent. Other messages, which were sent later may be delivered earlier. You can use this mode when the sequence that messages are received is less important than the speed of their arrival. In this mode message delivery still enforced, but the ordering is not. This mode can be thought of as a halfway house between TCP and UDP.

The remaining modes are equivelent to a UDP based protocols with differing retry/failure rules.

There is no DCEP  NACK.
DataChannel opens always succeed, because they are carried on the same SCTP stream as the data which as already suceeded!
#### PPID
The SCTP PPID for WebRTC DCEP is 50. DCEP messages are processed apart from the rest of the data in the SCTP stream and not passed back up to the web application or service.
#### Parameter exchange
In theory it is possible to create a datachannel using out-of-band non-DCEP negotiation in SDP. Don't.
